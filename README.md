# Open3D Point Cloud Processing 

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates various point cloud processing operations using the Open3D library. Open3D is an open-source library for 3D data processing, and it provides a wide range of tools for handling and analyzing point cloud data.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Open3D installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install open3d
``` 

## Loading a Point Cloud
The code starts by loading a point cloud from a PCD (Point Cloud Data) file using the o3d.io.read_point_cloud function.

## Visualizing the Point Cloud
The point cloud is visualized using o3d.visualization.draw_geometries. This function opens a 3D viewer and displays the point cloud.

## Basic Point Cloud Operations
1. __Downsampling the Point Cloud:__ The point cloud is downsampled using voxel_down_sample to reduce the number of points for faster processing.

2. __Estimating Normals:__ Normals are estimated for the downsampled point cloud to assist in subsequent operations like plane segmentation and clustering.

3. __Segmenting the Point Cloud using RANSAC:__ The RANSAC algorithm is used to segment the point cloud into inliers (points belonging to a plane) and outliers (noise points).

4. __Clustering the Point Cloud using DBSCAN:__ The DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm is applied to group points into clusters based on their spatial density.


## Visualization of Results
The script visualizes the results of each operation to help you understand the different stages of point cloud processing.
